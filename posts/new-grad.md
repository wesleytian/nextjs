Disclaimer: The intended audience of this post is new grad software engineers. These thoughts may not apply to jobseekers with more experience or those in non-engineering type roles.

I was sitting on a half-baked (and super verbose) post about why I decided to join an early-stage startup over a more mature company like a Big Tech company for quite a few months now. After Zooming with half a dozen of soon-to-be new grads in the past few weeks who wanted to learn about why I made the decision to join an early-stage company instead of a mid-stage company, I decided that a more valuable post would simply detail the reasons for joining __each__ stage of startup/company.

## Reasons to Join Companies at Each Stage (Early, Mid, Late, & Mature)

### Early-Stage Startups
__My Definition__:
- Funding: None, Pre-Seed, Seed, or Series A ($0-$25M)
- \# of Employees: 1-25
- Goal: looking for product-market fit (generating enough revenue to raise a next round or become profitable) before money runs out
- Examples: [Atmos](https://buildatmos.com/), [Virtually](https://tryvirtually.com), [Welcome](https://www.experiencewelcome.com/)

__Characteristics__:  
Responsibility ☆☆☆☆☆  
Impact/influence on the company ☆☆☆☆☆  
Cash compensation ☆☆  
Equity ☆☆☆☆☆  
Benefits ☆  

_(Rated from ☆ to ☆☆☆☆☆)_

Top reasons to join an early-stage startup: 
- You enjoy building for the sake of building. Bureaucracy is in its smallest form at a company of this size. More time to build and be in flow and less meetings. I have an average of 1-2 hours of meetings at the start of each day. I'm able to devote the rest of my time to uninterrupted engineering. (You hate meetings.)
- There's nothing else you'd rather be working on. (You're passionate about the company mission.)
- ["It’s often easier to take risks early in your career; you don’t have much to lose, and you potentially have a lot to gain."](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful) - [Sam Altman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman) (CEO @ OpenAI, President @ Y Combinator)
- You want to start your own company one day. There's no better place to learn how to solve early-stage company problems than at an early-stage startup. For example, learning about finding product-market fit is only something you can only do at an early-stage company. You'll also be able to wear multiple hats (sales, customer support, product development, design, hiring, etc.)–all things that founders are expected to do early on.

### Mid-Stage Startup
__My Definition__:
- Funding: Series B or C ($25M-$250M)
- \# of Employees: 25-250
- Goal: Taking newly found product-market fit and successfully scaling operations and revenue without losing too much money. In my opinion, this is easier than finding product-market fit, but still quite hard.  The stats back this up–more companies fail at an early-stage than at a mid-stage. Sometimes the market just isn't big enough or the company isn't able to capture a sizable chunk of the market quickly enough.
- Examples: [Clumio](https://clumio.com/), [SambaNova](https://sambanova.ai/), [Loom](https://loom.com), etc.

__Characteristics__:  
Responsibility ☆☆☆☆  
Impact/influence on the company ☆☆☆☆  
Cash compensation ☆☆☆☆  
Equity ☆☆☆  
Benefits ☆☆☆

Top reasons to join a mid-stage startup: 
- You're smart and want the choice that results in the highest [expected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_return) (risk-adjusted) financial and career return. (You can potentially make much more money at an early-stage startup, but because the probability of that happening is so much lower, the expected return is also much lower.)
- ["Right after school, join a mid-sized company with momentum. Those are the companies most likely to succeed, and to give you
the career halo you need. Again, the caveat: I know some students
who are so eager to change the world that they can’t be dissuaded
from trying a startup, first. For them, the right advice is: Go to the
startup."](https://cdn.wealthfront.com/public.email.images/2013_Silicon_Valley_Career_Guide.pdf#page=13&zoom=100,60,309) - [Andy Rachleff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Rachleff) (CEO @ Wealthfront, Co-Founder @ Benchmark Capital)

### Late-Stage Startup
__My Definition__:
- Funding: Recently IPO'ed or Series D+ round ($250M+)
- \# of Employees: 250-2,500
- Goal: These days, companies don't 
- Examples: Robinhood, [Snowflake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowflake_Inc.), DoorDash, etc.

__Characteristics__:  
Responsibility: ☆☆  
Impact/influence on the company: ☆☆  
Cash compensation: ☆☆☆☆  
Equity:☆☆  
Benefits:☆☆☆☆

__Top reasons to join a late-stage "startup"*__:
- You want to use the brand name as leverage to get into other companies-including early and mid-stage startups.
- You want to get rich quick. This is probably the fastest and most reliable way to make a ton of money in a short period of time. Look for companies that plan on going public in around a year and join it. Your shares are most likely going to appreciate in value, sometimes even netting 5x multiples such as with Snowflake's IPO. If you had graduated last May and went straight to work at Snowflake, you'd be worth close to a million on paper now.
- Late-stage startups can help build up domain expertise that only certain companies have the market position for. These companies could've only grown to this size by doing something right. They've validated their business.  

_*Even though [some people](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/linkedin-top-startups-2020-50-us-companies-rise-jessi-hempel/) still call these companies startups, at this point, I really don't consider them to be anymore... They've found product-market fit, scaled up their operations successfully to be generating sizable revenue and the only thing they need to do now is to keep doing what they've been doing. They're no longer taking something from [0-1](https://fs.blog/2014/09/peter-thiel-zero-to-one/), they're taking something from 1-n which is orders of magnitude easier._

### Mature Companies
__My Definition__:
- Funding: Public for quite some while or could have gone public a while ago but are just choosing to stay private (e.g. SpaceX) for a multitude of reasons.
- \# of Employees: 2,500+
- Goal: Maintain their market dominance–[sometimes monopoly](https://www.wired.com/story/google-antitrust-lawsuits-explainer/)–through lobbying, hiring, acquisitions, and other dubious tactics.
- Examples: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc.

__Characteristics__:  
Responsibility ☆  
Impact/influence on the company ☆  
Cash compensation ☆☆☆☆  
Equity ☆  
Benefits ☆☆☆☆☆

__Top reasons to join a mature company:__ 
- You want to learn skills related to success in big organizations, usually defined by how high you climb on the corporate ladder. Some of these skills include navigating politics, selling (your ideas), presenting, and contributing effectively to large codebases.
- You want to do research. Companies of smaller sizes rarely have the resources to fund research groups. There are exceptions like [Clinc](https://clinc.com), however.
- You want to use the brand name as leverage to get into other companies-including early and mid-stage startups or to raise money for your own company. Regardless of what people may say, credentialing will give you an edge. Though, if your goal is to found a company, founders (e.g. Dug Song, CEO & Founder of Duo Security (acq. by Cisco for $2.4B)) and investors I've talked to say they would rather invest in somebody with startup experience than Big Tech experience.
- You don't mind meetings.

### Factors Independent of Company Stage
- __Work-life balance__  
This completely depends on the company. For example, some teams at Facebook work 80 hours a week. At Virtually, we average 40-50 these days. Early-stage companies don't necessarily work you harder than late-stage companies. This is a common myth.
- __Mentorship opportunities__  
There is also the myth that startups offer fewer mentorship opportunities. This is generally true–especially so if your company is underfunded. However, you'd be surprised at the kind of people you can meet as well. My mentors at Virtually have included:
	- [Ish Baid](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ish-baid-11645b87) (Prev: Software Eng @ Facebook)  
	- [Dhanajoy Biswas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/corei13/?originalSubdomain=bd) (Prev: Employee #1 & Lead Software Architect @ [Backpack](https://backpackbang.com/) (YC S14)–Now the largest e-commerce company in Bangladesh, Software Eng @ Google, 2x ACM ICPC World Finalist)  
	- [Michael Kelly](http://michaelckelly.com/) (Prev: Employee #1 @ [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) (acq. by Visa for $5.3B))  
	and to a lesser extent Virtually's advisors and investors:
	- [Li Fan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Fan_(engineer)) (CTO @ Lime, Prev: SVP & Head of Eng @ Pinterest, Sr. Director of Eng @ Google)
	- [Snir Kodesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/snirkodesh) (Director of Eng @ Lyft, Prev: Co-Founder @ Hitch (acq. by Lyft)).

	\* I have no idea if this is typical of early-stage startups. My ultimate point is that the variance of quality of mentorship within a given stage of company is likely greater than the variance of mentorship between different stages of companies.
	
	The main difference between mentorship at early-stage and later-stage companies is that you'll meet more early engineers and founders at the former. None of the people I've learned from at Virtually have the kind of specialized experience as people at later-stage companies do, such as my mentor at Microsoft, [Doug Lenox](https://www.linkedin.com/in/doug-lenox-778a20149/), who has 7+ years of backend engineering experience (specializing in building microservices). The question you should be asking yourself is, "what kind of things do I want to learn"?

### Final Note
It's fun to plan out your career, but as I've learned from experience, trying to predict the future is a total crapshoot. Still, I think it's better to have a plan than to have no plan at all. Ultimately, I would try to optimize for a job with __co-workers whose company you enjoy__ and one __that's meaningful to you__–regardless of whether that's at a small company or a big one–as they both seem to be [top predictors of long-term happiness](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/wsu-sandbox/chapter/the-pursuit-of-happiness/). If you're in the fortunate position of being able to nab offers from companies at different stages, I'd worry less about money this early in your career and more about what best sets you up for long-term happiness. For me personally, that was an early-stage startup. Second choice? Late-stage.
