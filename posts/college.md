I can't believe it's already been a year since I've graduated from college. College was such an incredible experience and I'm glad that I was  fortunate enough to attend one. I'm incredibly grateful to my parents who paid for my 4.5 years of college tuition so I could focus on my studies. I can't even imagine what it would be like to have to pay for 4.5 years of college by taking on like $200,000 of student debt. There's really no good reason why college should be that expensive.

My complaints about the exclusivity of the college experience aside, I'd like to reflect and go over a few of the most useful learnings that I took away from college.

### 1. Put Your Classes on the Backburner
The thing about college is that nobody ever remembers what they learned. You'll have some concepts etched somewhere inside your brain, but because of how the American education is, you're basically always trying to cram for exams and get good grades without really learning or understanding the material. Thus, when I think back on college, the things that were the most memorable for me were the things that I did outside of class. Some of these experiences include
- LeaderShape Institute, a week-long leadership retreat in northern Michigan where we discussed heavy social issues.
- Helping run and lead the Michigan Data Science Team. I wrote in length about why it was the most fulfilling thing in college for me [here](/posts/president).
- Exploring Ann Arbor's vibrant restaurant scene during the summer, running in the arb in the spring, and hanging out and going tubing with my [Clinc](https://clinc.com) co-workers on July 4th at the Huron river.
- Internships
- Hackathons - The majority of my projects in my [projects](/projects) page were worked on during my free time. I would even classify a few of my class projects as extracurricular because I could've stopped at the minimum to receive an A, but I wanted to spend extra time perfecting something, whether that was perfecting a 20-page paper instead of taking an easy final exam, or trying to get first in class competitions.
- Books I read such as Sapiens and Excellent Sheep which I think were life-changing for me.

Being a TA, doing research, staying up with friends and chatting into the AMs, volunteering, participating in a club sport, etc. are all great things to be doing outside of class. As long as your actively participating in some community that isn't just your class.

My point here isn't to fail your classes or just do the bare minimum in them, but rather, don't __only__ focus on your classes. Many high-achievers I know spent all of their waking hours studying and I believe they'd be more successful and happier if they hadn't.

### 2. Make Friends and Network
I think the highest leverage thing you can do in college for your career and personal happiness is to make friends and connections by spending time with people you find interesting or enjoy hanging out with. 
- Post-graduation, as I was looking for early-stage startups to join, my friend Anant Akash who I had met and befriended during my last semester at UMich was able to refer me to amazing people and companies that I had no idea existed. I tried to be friends with him initially just because I thought he was smart and we had mutual interests.
- I took a chance to work with Associate Professor Rui Wang at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and eventually became really good friends with him. He's been a huge mentor to me.
- It's not just about the potential opportunities that can arise from knowing people, but I think you're able to become a more unique and interesting person the more people you know. Plus, we're social animals and most of us would be quite lonely without other people.

The other big thing is to not spread yourself to thin. If I had to pick, I'd choose quality over quantity any day.

Speaking from experience, actively try to maintain your network after college. It's easy to just move somewhere and to never speak to some of your connections ever again. It's infinitely more difficult to make friends out of college than in college. You're basically paying to be surrounded with people who are similar in age and interests as you. Use it. Perhaps the pandemic may have also had to do with it, but it's definitely much harder to make friends out of college so be warned.

### 3. Explore and Push Yourself



### 4. Take Care of Yourself
Push yourself, but also don't forget to take care of yourself. Everybody is different and as clich√©d as it is, don't compare yourself to others too much (I think a bit is fine). I could've been much happier if I hadn't all those times. I know people who aren't with us anymore because of issues that they could've tried to address earlier on. College is known for its experience, but many colleges are also known for the stress and syndromes such as the "paddling-duck syndrome" where students try to act like they're living well but are actually struggling underneath the surface. Cornell had nets put up underneath their bridges because of how many young people were taking their lives.

Please, please, please eat and sleep and exercise. Even if it's just 15 minutes of jogging or pushups each morning, without good health, you won't be able to enjoy or do anything else in life.
