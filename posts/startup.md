### Reason 1. <strike>Goodbye work-life balance</strike> Work-life balance depends more on the company you work at than on the stage of the company

Since we graduated from [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/)'s startup accelerator program and hired a full-time customer success lead, product designer, another engineer, and a handful of interns, I'm able to work around 40-50 hours a week. Yet, I know people at Big Tech companies who work 80 hours a week, every week. Interestingly, this also comes as news to other people at those same Big Tech companies. Not only is work-life balance company-dependent, but it also seems to be invariably team-dependent.

During Y Combinator, I did occasionally work 80-90 hours a week. But that was because we were trying to maximize our fundraising potential during YC's demo day, and the company consisted of just the founder and me. And the more people you have, the greater the division of labor and the more efficient things become due to less time wasted from context switching (thanks capitalism). 

**Takeaway:** On average, startups probably do have less work-life balance than bigger companies. I've never heard of engineers at Big Tech companies working 6 days a week, 15 hours a day like engineers at another YC company in our batch did. However, it really comes down to the company and team.

### Reason 2. <strike>You'll pick up bad engineering practices</strike> You can pick up decent engineering practices

Again, this is dependent on the company. In my experience, I've been fortunate to pick up decent engineering practices, perhaps better ones than if I were working at most companies in the world. The reasons for this are as follows.

1. I began my time at Virtually by working on the codebase with Ish, who spent close to 2 years total as a software engineer at Facebook and worked under a core [React](https://brainhub.eu/blog/10-famous-apps-using-reactjs-nowadays/) library creator. Though Ish wasn't titled a senior engineer, I learned from somebody who learned from one of the best.

2. Later, I worked with other full-time employees and contractors well-versed in engineering, from a senior engineer with years of experience at PayPal and Coinbase to an ex-Google, 2x ACM ICPC world finalist, who was also the chief architect at the largest e-commerce company in Bangladesh. 

3. We also discovered and started using [pullrequest.com](https://pullrequest.com), which offers Code Review as a Service. They employ people like [Elifaz Filho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elifaz/), a senior software engineer at Facebook, and [Dylan Drop](https://www.pullrequest.com/blog/code-reviewer-spotlight-dylan-drop/), a director of software engineering at GruhHub to review my code.

With phenomenal and experienced talent like these working alongside us (some of whom spend dedicated time reviewing our code as their job), it is only natural that we pick up some great engineering practices.

Sometimes, code quality does take a spot on the backburner because of higher priority tasks (which often happened during YC).  However, there's a difference between knowing what to do and not doing it due to business priorities and not knowing what to do. The key is learning what the right things are to do, even if there isn't time to do them then and now. And as things become more stable, we focus on making sure that our code is up to a high-quality standard.

**Takeaway:** Thus, if you are a junior engineer looking to join a startup, I would suggest joining one with technical founders or senior engineers who can put in place good engineering practices themselves or value the engineering expertise and find it worth the money to pay for a service such as pullrequest.com. Startups without technical management may sometimes feel that it is unnecessary to develop good engineering practices until it comes back and bites them in the ass later.

* *An interesting thing that I want to point out is that Big Tech companies usually have good practices through trial-and-error, but they're most likely stuck in local optima of practices, processes, and culture. Being at a startup means that you can help create a new set of practices and processes previously unknown to the world that could be better than those used at a Big Tech. Every new successful company with different practices and culture than existing ones is proof of this.*

### Reason 3. <strike>Less mentorship</strike> Great mentorship?

Because I haven't worked at a normal company where you aren't fighting to stay alive, I probably have a different definition of "mentorship." However, I do know that my mentorship at Microsoft was less than ideal for me. I took advantage of Microsoft's internal directory to ask people out for lunch each week, but I soon realized that too few of the people I talked to had my target career. These people also didn't really know much about me as I didn't work with them, so the insights I got from these chats were usually pretty shallow. P

At Virtually, however, since some of our "mentors" are our co-workers and investors with shared interests in our success, they're able to offer advice that is more customized to our personality and work habits.

Though Ish (Virtually's founder and CEO) never stayed at Facebook long enough to officially become a senior engineer, he's taught me subtle React optimizations that even our senior engineer didn't know. He's also drilled into me the values of building trust and moving fast. Michael Kelly, who was the first employee at [Plaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaid_(company))), taught me a lot about ego and what it means to be a founding member of a company that you aren't technically a founder of. Dhanajoy Biswas, the first employee and Lead Software Architect at Backpack (YC S14) and a previous software engineer at Google, taught me how he dealt with imposter syndrome and served as an invaluable advisor as I took on a massive data migration project. I'm also excited for one of the first engineers of Brex to join us soon so I can seek guidance from him as well.

To me, I'm happy that I've received advice from "mentors" who have helped me grow. Perhaps there is a side to mentorship that I haven't experienced, and I'm missing out. But until then, the grass will be green enough on my side.

**Takeaway:** Ultimately, it comes down to what kind of mentors you want. Do you want to learn from people who helped build a company from scratch or employees who are accomplished at bigger companies? If you want the former, they'll be harder to find at a Big Tech. (Probably because they've been spoiled by the autonomy of a smaller company.)

### Reason 4. <strike>You won't get rich</strike> You won't get very rich at a big company

The chance of joining one of these rocketships early on is indeed incredibly slim. And the risk-adjusted financial outcome of joining a startup is probably lower than joining FAANG or a late-stage startup. But, what is the probability that you will become a decamillionaire by working at a Big Tech company as an engineer? 0%. Not even 0.00000001%. Literally zero. Though there is a significant variance in startup outcomes, you still have a shot at incredible wealth by joining a startup. Whereas if you join a Big Tech company, you won't have any shot at all.

Additionally, not all startups are created equal. It's silly to say that all startups have an equal chance of failing. For example, do you think Elon Musk would have the same chance of successfully a company as a high schooler? Obviously not. Likewise, research concludes that the average startup fails with a [50% chance in their 5th year](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040915/how-many-startups-fail-and-why.asp), but for YC companies, [the probability is only 20%.](https://www.ycdb.co/batch/w16)

**Takeaway:** Startups is the only shot you have at becoming very rich (> $10M). Not all startups are created equal. Look for startups that you think are going to break the curve.

### Reason 5. <strike>Bad management</strike> You are management

I haven't spent very long at companies of sizes greater than 2 digits, so what I'm saying may not apply to bigger companies. At early-stage startups, if you're able to build up trust with your managers/founder(s), you will have a large say in how you are managed.

Founders/managers will often take your feedback to heart because they understand that if they don't, you'll leave, and if people start quitting because of a toxic culture, the company will die. Unfortunately, they may not already be a great manager, but the aligned incentives do make it better. Even more so because first-time managers at startups are common, you should tell them if they do something you don't like or want them to do something more. Whereas if you have a terrible manager at a larger company, your only hope is to switch teams or leave the company.

Finally, Chip is correct in saying that the business's needs are often prioritized over individual needs at startups. Because without a thriving business, you won't have your job for long. Put simply, if your needs aren't aligned with the needs of growing the business, don't join a startup.

### Reason 6. <strike>You might have to do a lot of things you don't want to do</strike> You get to do a lot of things that founders get to do

Do you know who else has to do a lot of things that they don't want to do? Founders. When you're working at an early-stage startup, you might indeed have to do things that you don't want to. But, if you want to be successful at anything in life, you have to get used to doing things you don't want.

The best way to learn how to be a founder is by being one. The next best way is to join an early-stage startup. At the end of the day, you guys will be working super close together, and your incentives will all be aligned (increasing revenue, reducing burn, hiring well), unlike at bigger companies (passing performance reviews, forming alliances). Bigger companies are so bureaucratic that they've devised different metrics at every company level to maintain some semblance of efficiency. It's not the job of a junior-level engineer to care about company revenue. Salespeople do well by increasing conversions. Because you live and die by revenue at a smaller company, it's in your complete interest to care about the company's income.

**Takeaway:** Join an early-stage startup if you want to get your hands dirty and grow the company, not if you want to only work on the glamorous bits. The bigger the company you join, the fewer hats you will wear.


<a name="reason7"></a>
### Reason 7. <strike>No clear career growth trajectory</strike> You grow your career by growing the company

There is indeed no clear career growth trajectory at early-stage startups like at big companies. There aren't bi-annual performance reviews that you try to pass (I've heard of people that even try to game these through playing politics) to get promoted to E4 or L5. 

However, you can grow your career exponentially faster than at a larger company by growing the company. Suppose you help create engineering processes that reduce the number of outages and, in effect, increase revenue. In that case, you'll have developed more skills to talk about during an interview than if you had worked at a bigger company.

Thus, instead of growing your career by being promoted to L4/E5, grow the company by increasing revenue and achieving scale. It becomes more straightforward if you look at it in terms of KPIs. For example, a goal for you could be to raise a Series A by achieving 80K MRR. You can do this by improving processes or building a bug-free feature. When you interview for your next position, you'll be able to describe precisely how and what you learned to scale your company. Join a startup if you want to gain skills related to entrepreneurship, don't join a startup if your goal is to climb neatly placed titles.

### One reason not to join a startup

Don't join a startup if you don't believe in the company (you/the team/the product/the mission) enough to think it'll be an outlier.

**Founders and early-stage startup employees don't sit on their asses all day long analyzing their company's probability of success and expected financial return. If these people all expected their result to be a failure, then Y Combinator wouldn't exist. Silicon Valley wouldn't exist. Only when you genuinely believe you can change the world will the world conspire to make it happen. As Steve Jobs said best, *"the people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do."* And this is why I think optimists will always rule the world.**

Do you believe in your founder(s)/the team/the mission/yourself enough to join the startup? Do you think you're joining the next [_insert Big Tech company name here_]?

### Acknowledgement

This is the other side of the coin to Chip Huyen's recent blog post, [7 reasons not to join a startup and 1 reason to](https://huyenchip.com/2021/02/27/why-not-join-a-startup.html). My goal here isn't to negate everything that she said but rather to offer a different perspective, perhaps rarer and more optimistic than the norm in the startup world. The reason why I haven't responded directly to everything that Chip said is that I do, in fact, think most of what Chip said is incredibly valid.

Thanks to Douglas Qian and _your name here_ for offering your thoughts and making sure everything makes sense to somebody who isn't me.
