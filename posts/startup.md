This is the other side of the coin to Chip Huyen's recent blog post, *7 reasons **not to** join a startup and 1 reason **to***. My goal isn't to negate everything that she's said but instead offer a balance to her perspective–one more optimistic than the norm in the startup world. You'll notice that I haven't responded directly to everything that Chip said because I do think most of what Chip said is valid. It's just a bit one-sided. Hopefully, by reading both of our posts, you'll get a more complete sense of what working at a startup is like. You can find her post [here](https://huyenchip.com/2021/02/27/why-not-join-a-startup.html).

### Reason 1. <strike>Goodbye work-life balance</strike> Work-life balance depends more on the company you work at than on the stage of the company

Since we graduated from [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/)'s startup accelerator program last summer and hired a customer success lead, product designer, software engineer, and a handful of interns, I've been working 40-50 hours a week. Yet, I know people at Big Tech companies who work 80 hours a week, year-round. Interestingly, this also comes as news to other people at those same Big Tech companies. Not only is work-life balance company-dependent, but it also seems to be invariably team-dependent.

During YC, I did occasionally work 80-90 hours a week. But that was because we were trying to maximize our fundraising potential during Demo Day, and the company consisted of just the founder and me. The more people you have, the greater the division of labor, and the more efficient things become due to less time wasted from context switching (thanks capitalism). 

**Takeaway:** On average, startups probably do have less work-life balance than bigger companies. I've never heard of engineers at Big Tech companies working 6 days a week, 15 hours a day like engineers at another YC company in our batch did. However, it really comes down to the company and the team.

### Reason 2. <strike>You'll pick up bad engineering practices</strike> You can pick up decent engineering practices

Again, this is dependent on the company. In my experience, I've been fortunate to pick up decent engineering practices, perhaps better ones than if I were working at most companies in the world. The reasons for this are as follows.

1. I began my time at Virtually by working on the codebase with Ish, who spent close to 2 years as a software engineer at Facebook and was mentored by a core [React](https://brainhub.eu/blog/10-famous-apps-using-reactjs-nowadays/) library developer.

2. Later, I worked with other employees and contractors well-versed in engineering– from a senior engineer with years of experience at PayPal and Coinbase to an ex-Google, 2x ACM ICPC world finalist, and lead software architect at the largest e-commerce company in Bangladesh.

3. Recently, we also started using [pullrequest.com](https://pullrequest.com), which offers Code Review as a Service. They employ people like [Elifaz Filho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elifaz/), a senior software engineer at Facebook, and [Dylan Drop](https://www.pullrequest.com/blog/code-reviewer-spotlight-dylan-drop/), a director of software engineering at GruhHub to review my code.

Occasionally, code quality does take a spot on the backburner because of higher priority tasks (which often happened during YC). However, there's a difference between not knowing what to do and knowing what to do but not doing it due to business priorities. The key is slowly moving from the former to the latter, even if sometimes code quality is jeopardized.

Though our engineering practices haven't always been the best, we've quickly realized their importance and how they can reduce bugs which directly impacts revenue. With this in mind, we maintain and seek good practices only if they will help us in the long-run and not do it for the sake of learning good practices.

**Takeaway:** Thus, if you are a junior engineer looking to join a startup, I would suggest joining one with technical founders or senior engineers. Not only can they put in place good engineering practices themselves, but they are also more likely to value good engineering practices and pay for services such as PullRequest. Startups without technical management may sometimes feel that it is unnecessary to develop good engineering practices until it comes back and bites them in the ass.

* *Just because Big Tech companies usually have good practices through trial-and-error, it doesn't mean they've reached a global optimum. Startups often create new practices and processes better suited for their business than those used at a Big Tech. Every successful company with different practices than existing ones is proof of this (e.g., moving fast and breaking things works much better at Facebook than at Boeing).*

### Reason 3. <strike>Less mentorship</strike> Great mentorship?

Because I haven't worked at a typical company where you aren't fighting to stay alive, I probably have a different definition of "mentorship." However, I do know that my mentorship at Microsoft was less than ideal for me. I took advantage of Microsoft's internal directory to ask people out for lunch each week, but I soon realized that too few of the people I talked to had my target career. These people also didn't really know much about me as I didn't work with them, so the insights I got from these chats were usually pretty shallow. I  had a mentor assigned to me, but I also didn't work closely with him–either in physical proximity or in work.

At Virtually, however, since some of my "mentors" are my co-workers, they're able to offer advice that is more customized to my personality and work habits.

Though Ish (Virtually's founder and CEO) never stayed at Facebook long enough to officially become a senior engineer, he's taught me subtle React optimizations that even our senior engineer didn't know. He's also drilled into me the values of building trust and moving fast. I  worked with the first employee at [Plaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaid_(company)) ([valued at $15B](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2021/01/plaid-raising-at-15bn-as-employees-pitched-1200-per-share/#:~:text=Plaid%20is%20currently%20in%20the,it%20before%20the%20failed%20merger.&text=And%20such%20a%20share%20price%20tag%20pushes%20Plaid's%20valuation%20to%20%2420%20billion.)) and he taught me a lot about ego and what it means to be a founding member of a company that you aren't technically a founder of. [Dhanajoy Biswas](https://www.toptal.com/resume/dhananjoy-biswas), the first employee and Lead Software Architect at [Backpack](https://backpackbang.com/) (YC S14), taught me how he dealt with imposter syndrome and served as an invaluable advisor as I took on a massive data migration project. I'm also excited for one of the first engineers of Brex (YC W17 and [currently valued at ~$8B](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/brex-valuation-could-reach-8-billion-in-new-funding-round)) to join us soon so I can seek guidance from him as well.

These are some examples of what mentorship means to me, and I'm content that I've received advice from these people who have helped and watched me grow. Perhaps there is a side to mentorship that I haven't experienced, and I'm missing out. But until then, the grass will be green enough on my side.

**Takeaway:** Ultimately, it comes down to what kind of mentors you want. Do you want mentors who have experience building companies from scratch and might work alongside you? Or do you want mentors who are more specialized in their fields and might not know you as well?

### Reason 4. <strike>You won't get rich</strike> You won't get very rich at a big company

The chance of joining a rocketship like Plaid is indeed incredibly slim, and the risk-adjusted financial outcome of joining the average startup is lower than joining FAANG or a late-stage startup. However, not all startups are created equal. It's silly to say that all startups have an equal chance of failing. For example, do you think Elon Musk would have the same chance of successfully building a company as a high schooler? Obviously not. Likewise, research concludes that the average startup fails with a [50% chance in their 5th year](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/040915/how-many-startups-fail-and-why.asp), but for YC companies, [the probability is only 20%.](https://www.ycdb.co/batch/w16)

Furthermore, what is the probability that you will become a decamillionaire by working at a Big Tech company as an engineer? 0%. Not even 0.00000001%. Literally zero. Though there is a significant variance in startup outcomes, you still have a shot at incredible wealth by joining a startup. One of our contractors who joined Plaid right out of college 7 years is worth [$60M now](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2021/01/plaid-raising-at-15bn-as-employees-pitched-1200-per-share/#:~:text=Plaid%20is%20currently%20in%20the,it%20before%20the%20failed%20merger.&text=And%20such%20a%20share%20price%20tag%20pushes%20Plaid's%20valuation%20to%20%2420%20billion.)–assuming he received somewhere around 50K shares (0.5% of the 10M shares usually issued at incorporation). Whereas if you join a Big Tech company, you won't have any shot at that kind of wealth at all. Plus, you get taxed much more on ordinary income than on long-term capital gains.

**Takeaway:** 1. Starting a company or joining an early-stage startup is the easiest shot you have to becoming very rich (> $10M). It's impossible at a Big Tech company. 2. Not all startups are created equal. Look for startups that you think are going to break the curve. 

* *Your first priority should still be to work with people and on a mission that you're passionate about so that even if the company does fail, you'll still have had the time of your life.*

### Reason 5. <strike>Bad management</strike> You are management

I haven't spent very long at companies of sizes greater than 1 digit, so what I'm saying may not apply to most companies. In my experience, if you're able to build up trust with your managers/founder(s), you will have a large say in how you are managed.

Although first-time managers/founders are common at startups, having aligned incentives can make it better. If you and your founder/manager have the same goal of building a healthy culture and scaling the company, they will often take your feedback to heart because they understand that if they don't, people will start leaving, and the company will die. Whereas if you have a terrible manager at a larger company, your only hope is to switch teams or leave the company.

**Takeaway:** Chip is correct in saying that business needs are often prioritized over individual needs at startups. Without a thriving business, the company wouldn't even be able to pay you. Thus, if your needs aren't aligned with growing the business, don't join a startup.

### Reason 6. <strike>You might have to do a lot of things you don't want to do</strike> You get to do a lot of things that founders get to do

Do you know who else has to do a lot of things that they don't want to do? Founders. When you're working at an early-stage startup, you might indeed have to do things that you don't want to. But, if you hope to be successful at anything in life, you have to get used to doing things you don't want.

The best way to learn how to be a founder is by being one. The next best way is to join an early-stage startup. At the end of the day, you'll be working super close together, and your incentives will all be aligned (increasing revenue, reducing burn, hiring well), unlike at bigger companies (passing performance reviews, forming alliances). Bigger companies are so bureaucratic that they've devised different metrics at every company level to maintain some semblance of efficiency. It's not the job of a junior-level engineer to care about company revenue–they do well by focusing on performance reviews. Salespeople do well by increasing conversions.  At a smaller company, you live and die by how much money your company has, so it becomes less about you and more about doing what needs to get done as a company.

**Takeaway:** Join an early-stage startup if you want to get your hands dirty and grow the company, not if you want to only work on the glamorous bits. The bigger the company you join, the fewer hats you will wear. 


<a name="reason7"></a>
### Reason 7. <strike>No clear career growth trajectory</strike> You grow your career by growing the company

There is indeed no clear career growth trajectory at early-stage startups like at big companies. There aren't bi-annual performance reviews that you try to pass to get promoted to E4 or L5. I've heard of people that even try to game these through playing politics. 

However, you can grow your career exponentially faster than at a larger company by growing the company at a similar rate. Instead of growing your career by being promoted to L4/E5, grow the company by increasing revenue and outperforming KPIs. For example, a goal for the company could be to raise a Series A by achieving 80K MRR. By improving processes or building a bug-free feature, you can help bring on a new customer and net the company more revenue. When you interview for your next position, you'll be able to describe precisely how and what you learned to scale your company. As we move towards a more [skill-based and not title-based labor market](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/07/skills-not-job-titles-are-the-new-metric-for-the-labour-market/), these skills that you pick up will come in handy, especially if you're interested in startups.

**Takeaway:** Join a startup if you're interested in acquiring tangible skills related to building organizations from 0-1, don't join a startup if your goal is to climb neatly placed titles.

### One reason not to join a startup

Don't join a startup if you don't believe in the company (you/the team/the product/the mission) enough to think it'll be an outlier.

**Founders and early-stage startup employees don't sit on their asses all day analyzing their company's probability of success and expected financial return. If all of these people believed that their startups would fail–the expected and average outcome, then Y Combinator wouldn't exist. Silicon Valley wouldn't exist. Only when you genuinely believe you can change the world will the world conspire to make it happen. As Steve Jobs said best, *"the people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do."* This is why I think optimists will always rule the world.**

Do you believe in your founder(s)/the team/the mission/yourself enough to make the startup a success? Do you think you're joining the next [_insert Big Tech company name here_]?
