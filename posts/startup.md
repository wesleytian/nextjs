This is the other side of the coin to Chip Huyen's recent blog post, [7 reasons not to join a startup and 1 reason to](https://huyenchip.com/2021/02/27/why-not-join-a-startup.html#why_join_a_startup).

*Note to the reader:* I haven't made a direct response to every one of Chip's sentences as my goal here isn't to negate everything that she said, but rather to offer a different perspective–albeit one that is perhaps rarer and more optimistic than is the norm in the startup world. The reason why I haven't responded directly to everything that Chip said is that I do, in fact, think most of what Chip said is incredibly valid.

### Reason 1. <strike>Goodbye work-life balance</strike> Work-life balance depends on the company you work at, not the stage of the company

Since we graduated from [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) and hired a full-time customer success lead, product designer, another engineer, and a handful of interns, I work an average of 40-50 hours a week. Yet, I know people at Big Tech who work 80 hours a week, year-round. Surprisingly, this also comes as news to other people at those same Big Tech companies. Not only is work-life balance company-dependent, but it also seems to be team-dependent.

During Y Combinator, I occasionally worked 80-90 hours a week, averaging around 60-70, but it was just the founder and me at that point. The more people you have, the greater the division of labor and the more efficient things get (thanks capitalism). Additionally, the more money you have, the less leverage you need to gain by hustling. The three months going through YC was probably the most leveraged time we would ever have, which is why most companies hustle so much during YC. 

Though I do have to concede that–yes, in general, startups have less of a work-life balance. I heard from the Head of Eng. at another YC company (S20) that they work 6 days a week, 15 hours a day. 

At [Virtually](https://tryvirtually.com/), I think we all feel the pressure to work nights and weekends (and we sometimes do), but none of that comes from management. It's because we all want to make our customers happy, make the company more valuable, and be proud of the product we're building.

### Reason 2. <strike>You'll pick up bad engineering practices</strike> You can pick up some great engineering practices

Again, this is dependent on the company. In my experience, I've been fortunate to pick up great engineering practices, perhaps better ones than if I were working at most companies in the world. The reasons for this are as follows.

I began my time at Virtually by working on the codebase with Ish, who spent close to 2 years total as a software engineer at Facebook and worked under a core [React](https://brainhub.eu/blog/10-famous-apps-using-reactjs-nowadays/) library creator. Though Ish wasn't titled a senior engineer, I learned from somebody who learned from one of the best.

Later, I worked with other full-time employees and contractors well-versed in engineering, from a senior engineer with years of experience at PayPal and Coinbase to an ex-Google, 2x ACM ICPC world finalist, who was also the chief architect at the largest e-commerce company in Bangladesh. 

We also discovered and started using [pullrequest.com](https://pullrequest.com), which offers Code Review as a Service. They employ people like [Elifaz Filho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elifaz/), a senior software engineer at Facebook, and [Dylan Drop](https://www.pullrequest.com/blog/code-reviewer-spotlight-dylan-drop/), a director of software engineering at GruhHub to review my code.

With phenomenal and experienced talent like these working alongside us (some of whom spend dedicated time reviewing our code as their job), it is only natural that we pick up some great engineering practices.

Sometimes, code quality does take a spot on the backburner because of higher priority tasks (which often happened during YC).  However, there's a difference between knowing what to do and not doing it due to business priorities and not knowing what to do. The key is learning what the right things are to do, even if there isn't time to do them then and now. And as things become more stable, we focus on making sure that our code is up to a high-quality standard.

**Takeaway:** Thus, if you are a junior engineer looking to join a startup, I would suggest joining one with technical founders or senior engineers who can put in place good engineering practices themselves or value the engineering expertise and find it worth the money to pay for a service such as pullrequest.com. Startups without technical management may sometimes feel that it is unnecessary to develop good engineering practices until it comes back and bites them in the ass later.

* *Another thing that I want to point out is that the Tech Giants usually have good practices through trial-and-error, but they're most likely stuck in local optima of practices, processes, and culture. Being at a startup means that you can help create a new set of practices and processes previously unknown to the world that could be better than those used at a Big Tech. Every new successful company with different practices and culture than existing ones is proof of this.*

### Reason 3. <strike>Less mentorship</strike> Great mentorship

Because I've never worked at a Big Tech full-time, and I might never, I won't exactly know what it means to have a "mentor." Like Chip's experience at NVIDIA, I did have the opportunity to ping anyone while I was at Microsoft for coffee or lunch. This was great, except that I soon realized that too few of the people I asked advice from had my dream career. These people also didn't really know much about me as I didn't work with them, so the insights I got from these coffee chats were usually pretty surface-level. 

At Virtually, however, since some of our "mentors" are contractors that we hired or investors with a shared interest in our success, they're able to offer advice that is more customized to my personality and work habits. Sure, I don't technically refer to them as mentors, but I have and can schedule calls with any of them to seek advice. 

Some of these people that I've gotten to know and seek advice from include: 
- Ish Baid (Founder and CEO of Virtually)
- Sakib Sauro (Co-Founder and CTO of [Backpack–YC S14](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/backpack))
- Michael Kelly (Employee #1 at [Plaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaid_(company)))
- Dhanajoy Biswas (Employee #1 and Lead Software Architect at Backpack (YC S14), SWE at Google)
- My other teammates who have years of experience in their respective fields (e.g., product management, sales)
- [Li Fan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Fan_(engineer)) (CTO of [Lime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lime_(transportation_company)), SVP/Head of Eng. at Pinterest, Sr. Dir. of Eng. at Google)
- Snir Kodesh (Dir. of Eng. at Lyft ([LYFT](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/LYFT:NASDAQ?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjt55WV7p_vAhWTvZ4KHQ1zB80Q3ecFMAB6BAgREBo)), Co-Founder at Hitch–acq. by Lyft)

As a bonus to partially being in the YC network, I've also gotten to know other early engineers such as Nathan Leung (Employee #1 at [Jupiter–YC S19](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/12574)) and Ryan Choi (Dir. of [Work at a YC Startup](https://www.workatastartup.com/) and Employee #7 at Salesforce–[CRM](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/CRM:NYSE?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi_rZvH7Z_vAhVXrp4KHd9kAl0Q3ecFMAB6BAgOEBo)). Besides the investors, the great thing about these people is that they either know me or have experienced the career I aspire to have.

Ultimately, I think it comes down to what you want. Do you want to learn from people who helped build a company from scratch or employees who are accomplished at bigger companies? If you want the former, they'll be harder to find at a Big Tech. (Probably because they've been spoiled by the autonomy of a smaller company.)


<a name="reason4"></a>
### Reason 4. <strike>You won't get rich</strike> You believe you'll get rich

What is the probability that you will become a decamillionaire by working at FAANG as an engineer? 

0%. Not even 0.00000001%. Literally zero. Not even the non-founding CEOs of Google, Microsoft, or Amazon are billionaires. Why? It's because they don't have nearly as much equity as the founders.

The chance of joining one of these rocketships early on is indeed incredibly slim. And the risk-adjusted financial outcome of joining a startup is probably lower than joining FAANG or a late-stage startup. 

However, it doesn't even matter what the expected financial outcome of your company is. Join a startup/start a company if you believe you're an outlier, and your company will become a billion-dollar business. If your mindset is that most startups fail and your startup will just be another one to fail and that the expected return is less than joining FAANG, then yeah, don't join a startup. Also, see [my reason not to join a startup](#reasonnotto).

### Reason 5. <strike>Bad management</strike> You are management

This depends a lot on the company, but in my experience, if you join as an early employee and build up some trust with your managers/founder(s), then you will have a large say in how you are managed. In fact, I believe that management at early-stage startups is up to you in more ways than one. 

First, because first-time managers at startups are common, you should tell them if they do something you don't like or want them to do something more. Founders/managers will often take your feedback to heart because they understand that if they don't, you'll leave, and if people start leaving because of a toxic culture, the company will die. Unfortunately, they may not already be a great manager, but the aligned incentives part does make it better. Whereas if you have a bad manager at a larger company, your only hope is to switch teams or leave the company.

Additionally, as Chip mentioned, there is a good chance that your own management skills will come into play if the company continues growing. If you think your company has bad management and you're a manager, even if it's of 1 or 2 people, then it's on you. Listen to your employees, value them, treat them fairly, and have their interests at heart. If they're unsatisfied, then it will ultimately affect the company's culture and growth. These are things that any communicative and empathetic person can learn, even if they are a recent grad or new to management. 

I will agree that they may not have the best advice for how you can grow your career/what skills you're lacking due to a lack of personal experience.


<a name="reason6"></a>
### Reason 6. <strike>You might have to do a lot of things you don't want to do</strike> You get to do a lot of things that founders get to do

Do you know who else has to do a lot of things that they don't want to do? Founders. When you're working at an early-stage startup, you might indeed have to do things that you don't want to. But, if you want to be successful at anything in life, you have to get used to doing things you don't want.

The best way to learn how to be a founder is by being one. The next best way is to join an early-stage startup. At the end of the day, you guys will be working super close together, and your incentives will all be aligned (increasing revenue, reducing burn, hiring well), unlike at bigger companies (passing performance reviews, forming alliances). 

**Takeaway:** Join an early-stage startup if you want to get your hands dirty and grow the company, not if you want to only work on the glamorous bits. The bigger the company you join, the fewer hats you will wear.


<a name="reason7"></a>
### Reason 7. <strike>No clear career growth trajectory</strike> You grow your career by growing the company

There is indeed no clear career growth trajectory at early-stage startups like at big companies. There aren't bi-annual performance reviews that you try to pass (or game in some cases) to get promoted to E4/L4 or E5/L5. 

However, you can grow your career exponentially faster than at a larger company by growing the company. Suppose you help create engineering processes that reduce the number of outages and, in effect, increase revenue. In that case, you'll have developed more skills to talk about during an interview than if you had worked at a bigger company.

Thus, instead of growing your career by being promoted to L4/E5, grow the company by increasing revenue and achieving scale. It becomes more straightforward if you look at it in terms of KPIs. For example, a goal for you could be to raise a Series A by achieving 80K MRR. You can do this by improving processes or building a bug-free feature. When you interview for your next position, you'll be able to describe precisely how and what you learned to scale your company. Join a startup if you want to gain skills related to entrepreneurship, don't join a startup if your goal is to climb neatly placed titles.

### One reason not to join a startup

Don't join a startup if you don't believe in the company (you/the team/the product/the mission) enough to think it'll be an outlier.



**Successful entrepreneurs don't sit around on their asses analyzing their probability of success and expected financial return. If they all thought like this, then Y Combinator wouldn't exist. Silicon Valley wouldn't exist. Why start a company if you think you're going to fail? Only when you genuinely believe you can change the world will the world conspire to make it happen. As Steve Jobs said best, *"the people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do."* And this is why I think optimists will always rule the world.**

Do you believe in your founder(s)/the team/the mission/yourself enough to join the startup?  Do you think you're joining the next [_insert big tech company name here_]?
