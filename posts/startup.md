This is the other side of the coin of Chip Huyen's recent blog post, [7 reasons not to join a startup and 1 reason to](https://huyenchip.com/2021/02/27/why-not-join-a-startup.html#why_join_a_startup).

*Note to the reader:* I haven't made a direct response to every of Chip's sentences as my goal here isn't to negate everything that she said, but rather to offer a different perspective, albeit one that is perhaps rarer and more optimistic than is the norm in the startup world. In fact, the reason why I haven't responded directly to everything that Chip said is that I do in fact think most of what Chip said is incredibly valid.

### Reason 1. <strike>Goodbye work-life balance</strike> Work-life balance depends on the company you work at, not the stage of the company

_This isn't technically a reason to join a startup. It's just a commentary on work-life balance at startups._

Since we graduated from [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) and hired a full-time customer success lead, product designer, another engineer, and a handful of interns, I work an average of 40-50 hours a week. Yet, I know people at big tech companies who work 80 hours a week, year-round. However, it is unheard of to people on different teams at those same big tech companies. Not only is it company-dependent, but it's entirely team-dependent at big companies. 

During Y Combinator, I occasionally worked 80-90 hours a week, averaging around 60-70, but it was just the founder and me at that point. The more people you have, the greater the division of labor and the more efficient things get (thanks capitalism). Additionally, the more money you have, the less leverage you need to gain by hustling. The three months going through YC was probably the most leverage we would ever have, which is why most companies hustle so much during YC. 

Though I do have to concede thatâ€“yes, in general, startups have less of a work-life balance. I heard from the head of engineering at another YC company (S20) that they work 6 days a week, 15 hours a day. 

At Virtually, I think we all feel the pressure to work nights and weekends (and we sometimes do), but none of it comes from an external source, whether that is management or company culture. It's completed intrinsically motivated because we want to make our customers happy, build a better product, and make the company more valuable.


<a name="reason2"></a>
### Reason 2. <strike>You'll pick up bad engineering practices</strike> You can pick up some great engineering practices

Again, this is dependent on the company. In my experience, I've been fortunate to pick up great engineering practices, perhaps better ones than if I were working at most companies in the world. The reasons for this are as follows.

I began my time at Virtually by working on the codebase with Ish, who spent nearly 2 years as an engineer at Facebook and worked under one of the creators of the popular React framework. Though he's not a senior engineer by any means, I was able to learn from somebody who learned from one of the best.

Later, I worked with other full-time employees and contractors well-versed in engineering, from a senior engineer with years of experience at PayPal and Coinbase to an ex-Google, 3x ACM world finalist, who was also the chief architect at the largest e-commerce company in Bangladesh. 

Recently, we also discovered and started using [pullrequest.com](pullrequest.com), which offers Code Review as a Service. They employ people like [Elifaz Filho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elifaz/), a senior software engineer at Facebook, and [Dylan Drop](https://www.pullrequest.com/blog/code-reviewer-spotlight-dylan-drop/), a director of software engineering at GruhHub to review my code.

With phenomenal and experienced talent like these working alongside us (some of whom spend dedicated time reviewing our code as their job), it is only natural that we pick up some great engineering practices.

It's true that sometimes code quality takes a spot on the backburner because of higher priority tasks (which often happened during YC). However, there's a difference in knowing what to do and not doing it due to business priorities and not knowing what to do. The key is becoming more apparent what the right things are to do, even if there isn't time to do them then and now. And as things become more stable, we focus on making sure that our code is up to high standard of quality.

Takeaway: Thus, if you are a junior engineer looking to join a startup, I would suggest joining one with technical founders or senior engineers who can put in place good engineering practices themselves or value the engineering expertise and find it worth the money to pay for a service such as pullrequest.com. Startups without technical management may sometimes feel that it is unnecessary to develop good engineering practices until it comes back and bites them in the ass later.

* *Another thing that I want to point out is that big tech companies usually have good practices through trial-and-error, but they're most likely stuck in a local optima of practices, processes, and culture. Being at a startup means that you can help create a new set of practices and processes previously unknown to the world that could actually be better than those used at big tech companies. Every new successful company with different practices and culture than existing ones is proof of this.*

### Reason 3. <strike>Less mentorship</strike> Great mentorship

Because I've never worked at a big tech company full-time, and I might never, I won't exactly know what it means to have a "mentor." Similar to what Chip said in her post, I did have the opportunity to ping any person while I was at Microsoft for a coffee chat or lunch, though. This was great, except that I soon realized that extremely few of the people I was asking advice from had my dream career. These people also didn't really know much about me as I didn't work with them, so the insights I got from these coffee chats were usually pretty surface-level. 

At Virtually, however, since some of our "mentors" are contractors that we hired with or investors that have a shared interest in our success, they're able to offer advice that is more customized to my personality and work. Sure, I don't refer to them as mentors, but I have and am able to schedule calls with any of them to seek advice. 

Some of these co-workers or investors that I've sought advice from include Michael Kelly, employee #1 at Plaid, Li Fan, Snir Kodesh, Dhanajoy, Sauros,  my founder, Ish and my co-workers who have worked in industry in their respective fields much longer than I have. As a bonus to being in YC, I've also gotten to know other first engineers such as Nathan Leung, as well as the current director of Work at a YC Startup, Ryan Choi (also 7th engineer at Salesforce). Besides the investors, the great thing about these people is that they either know me or have experienced the career I aspire to have.

Ultimately, I think it comes down to what you want. Do you want to learn from other founders and early employees or ones that are accomplished at bigger companies? If you want the former, they'll be hard to find at big tech. (Probably because they've been spoiled by the autonomy of a smaller company.)

### Reason 4. <strike>You won't get rich</strike> You believe you'll get rich

What is the probability that you will become a decamillionaire by working at a big tech company as an engineer? 0% Not even 0.00000001%. Literally zero. Not even the non-founding CEOs of Google, Microsoft, or Amazon are billionaires. Why? It's simply because they don't have nearly as much equity as the founders. In fact, early employees at successful companies have made more than the executives that came on later.

It is true that the chance of joining one of these companies, probability-wise, is incredibly slim. And the financial outcome of joining a startup, risk-adjusted, is probably lower than joining big tech or a late-stage startup. 

It doesn't even matter what the expected financial outcome of your company is. Join a startup/start a company if you believe you're an outlier and your company will become a billion-dollar business. If your mindset is that most startups fail and your startup will just be another one to fail and that the expected return is less than joining big tech, then yeah, don't join a startup.


<a name="reason5"></a>
### Reason 5. <strike>Bad management</strike> You are management

This depends a lot on the company, but in my experience, if you join a company early enough and build up trust with your managers/founder(s), then you will have a large say in how you are managed. You are able to provide feedback that they value and take to heart. Because they understand that if they don't, you'll leave.

Additionally, like Chip mentioned, there is a good chance that your own management skills will come into play if the company continues growing. If you think your company has bad management and you're a manager, even if it's of 1 or 2 people, then it's on you. Listen to your employees, value them, treat them fairly, and have their interests at heart. If they're unsatisfied, then it will ultimately affect the company's culture and growth. These are things that any communicative and empathetic person can learn, even if they are a recent grad or new to management. 

I will agree that they may not have the best advice for how you can grow your career/what skills you're lacking due to a lack of personal experience.

### Reason 6. <strike>You might have to do a lot of things you don't want to do</strike> You get to do a lot of things that founders get to do

Do you know who else has to do a lot of things that they don't want to do? Founders. When you're working at an early-stage startup, it is true that you might have to do things that you don't want to. But, if you want to be successful at anything in life, you have to get used to doing things that you don't want to. 

The best way to learn how to be a founder is by being one. The next best way is to join an early-stage startup. At the end of the day, you guys will be working super close together and your incentives will all be aligned (increasing revenue, reducing burn, hiring well), unlike at bigger companies (passing performance reviews, forming alliances). 

**Takeaway:** Join an early-stage startup if you want to get your hands dirty and grow the company, not if you want to only work on the glamorous bits. The bigger the company you join, the fewer hats you will wear.


<a name="reason7"></a>
### Reason 7. <strike>No clear career growth trajectory</strike> You grow your career by growing the company

It is true that there is no clear career growth trajectory at early-stage startups like at big companies. There aren't bi-annual performance reviews that you try to pass (or game in some cases) in order to get promoted to E4/L4 or E5/L5. 

However, you can grow your career exponentially faster than at a larger company by growing the company. If you help create engineering processes that reduce the number of outages and in effect increase revenue, you'll have developed much more skills to talk about during an interview than if you had worked at a bigger company.

So if you want to grow your career, instead of trying to get promoted to L4 or E5, grow the company by increasing revenue and achieving scale. It is quite clear if you look at it in terms of KPIs. If the company achieves this much MRR (e.g. 80K) or this much GMV, then they will be this closer to raise a Series A or B. When you interview for your next position, you'll be able to describe exactly how and what you learned in order to scale your company. Join a startup if you want to gain skills related to entrepreneurship, don't join a startup if your goal is to climb neatly placed titles.

### One reason not to join a startup

You don't believe in the company (you/the team/the product/the mission) enough to think it'll be an outlier.

**As Steve Jobs said best, "the people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do." Successful entrepreneurs don't go around sitting on their asses analyzing what the probability of success is for them is and the expected amount of money they're going to make. If everybody thought like this, then Y Combinator wouldn't exist. Silicon Valley wouldn't exist. When you truly believe you can change the world, the world will conspire to make it happen. And this is why optimists will always rule the world.**

Do you believe in your founder(s)/the team/the mission/yourself enough to join the startup? 

Do you think you're joining the next [_insert big tech company name here_]?
