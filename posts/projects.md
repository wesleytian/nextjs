## Software

### [Fashion Filtr](https://devpost.com/software/fashion-filtr)

Awarded $6000 in API credits for "Most Creative Use of Indico API" @ HampHack 2017  
Teammates: [Nischal Tamang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nischal-tamang/) and [Phillip Michalowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phillip-michalowski/)  
Shopping for clothes online is hard. So, we leveraged Indico's deep transfer learning API to learn what your clothing preferences are and filter clothes based on them. We used Bootstrap for the front end, jQuery and Express to scrape websites, and Node.js for our server.

### [White Cane](https://devpost.com/software/unblind)
MHacks 11 Submission  
Teammates: [Ben Botvinick](https://benbotvinick.com/), [Anish Mahendran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anish-mahendran-88432a149/), and [Letao Chen](https://lokto.me/#/)  
Why use a white can when you can use your phone? We pulled two all-nighters in a row to successfully build a mobile app that helps the visually impaired navigate their surroundings by announcing what is around them and their relative positions to the user in real-time. We used Google Cloud Functions, Google Cloud Vision API, Firebase ML Kit, and Firebase Cloud Storage to build the app.

### [Rock, Paper, Scissors AI](https://github.com/wesleytian/roshambo-god)
Humans are notoriously bad at generating random sequences. Due to this observation, I used Bayesian inference to devise an AI that can predict your moves given a long enough play history. I used Java because that was my go-to programming language at the time.

### [wesleytian.com](/)  
Built the current site that you're on using React, JavaScript, Google Firebase Realtime Database, Next.js, and remark. Usually, I don't care for the choice of web technologies or programming languages used, but these libraries allow for quicker rendering and more customizability vs. Hugo or WordPress.

### [Digital Interview Experience]()
Awarded 1st Place out of 12 Teams @ Fidelity Investments Merrimack Hackathon  
Presented to 3 Fidelity Investment Senior VPs  
Teammates: [Mike Super](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikesuper/), [Akhil Yerra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akhil-yerra/),  
Helped build an Angular app that allows interview scheduling between many-to-many interviewer and interviewees.

## Hardware

### [Programmable Window AC Thermostat](/posts/ac_hack)
I was tired of not being able to set my window AC to a certain temperature (its only settings were low, medium, and high). So, I built a programmable thermostat that attaches and can control any window AC. I used C for the firmware, Blynk IoT platform, Ionic, for the mobile app, and EAGLE for the circuit board design. Thanks to [Rui (Ray) Wang](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~ruiwang/) for providing support, the lab space, and soldering tools.

### [Objective2 Headphone Amp](/posts/amp)
Being obsessed with sound quality at the time, I wanted to obtain a high-quality headphone amp at a low cost. I did some research and used a DIY kit to build the Objective2 headphone amp myself, saving a few hundred dollars.

### [From Human-Level Artificial Intelligence to Superintelligent Artificial Intelligence:​ Scenarios,​ Paths,​ and Counter Arguments](/projects/ai-paper.pdf)
Philosophy Paper  
Date: Dec 2017  
Word Count: 5,987  
>	"The paper as it stands now is a sensible appreciation of the
	singularity issues, that avoids the enthusiasm you often see in this
	area.  It shows extensive reading on the topic, as well as good
	thinking.  Probably it would be a  better paper if the excursions into programming languages and algorithmic complexity were pruned.    
	Computer science can use at least a few people who can
	appreciate and form opinions on the broader issues, you're well on
	your way to being one of those." - [Rich Thomason](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~rthomaso/), Advisor
