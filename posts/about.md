## Me

Hey, my name is Wesley Y. Tian. I'm a founding member of [Virtually](https://tryvirtually.com/) the "Shopify for Online Schools". As Virtually's first hire, I help out in multiple domains, but my forte is software engineering. We went through Y Combinator's startup accelerator program this past summer which culminated in a [1.75M seed round led by Tiger Global](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2020-09-28-a-shopify-for-online-schools-raises-1-75m-led-by-tiger-global).

I was born in Mountain View, California, and spent around 30% of my
preadult years in Milpitas, California; 15% in West Linn, Oregon; 10% in
Taiwan, Taipei; and 45% in Shanghai, China. Since then, I've also
resided in Amherst, Massachusetts (2 years); and Ann Arbor, Michigan (3 years)â€“primarily for my undergraduate studies.

I enjoy reading, studying physics, writing, and hiking in my
free time. I'm also currently preparing myself for [Ironman California](https://www.ironman.com/im-california) by running a lot.

Other (fun) facts about me:
- I'm a cadet private in the United States Army Cadet Corps (USAC). I graduated at the 
Millersburg Military Institute in Kentucky in 2013. At one point in my life, I wanted to join the US military. Potential careers included astronaut, pilot, and Navy SEAL. Didn't we all?
- I didn't know I had an older sister until I was 12-13.
- I can roll my tongue into a [cloverleaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue_rolling) shape (3 folds) ðŸ˜›.

## This Site

This snippet below pretty much sums up the reasons why I continue to maintain this site. I found it [here](https://breakoutlist.com/career-planning/#step-8). Plus, it's like volunteering. It feels good to know that you're providing value to others. I've had dozens of people reach out to me about how my writing has inspired them. I've also been able to make friends and connections through this site.

> Key takeaway: Once you get hired, make an effort to spread what you are learning and
building. 

> I think this is a great point. If you occasionally blog about
what you've been learning, or open-source a small module, great things
happen. 

> You become a more interesting person (at least in the context
where most people will research you, i.e. online), and you contribute
knowledge back to the world. 

> Of course, this can do great things five
years down the track when you are thinking about your next move.
