> *Note: This post is largely unfinished. There was obviously a whole lot more going on inside my head that led to my ultimate decision to sell 85% of my stock holdings than just a conversation with a friend. But until I add more to this post, here were some of my thoughts.*

On February 15th, 2020, I predicted that COVID-19, which was wrecking havoc in China at the time would soon spread to the United States and wreak havoc here.

On February 15th, 2020, I sold 85% percent of all my stocks.

On February 18th, 2020, the S&P 500 reached an all time high, despite the known deaths in China.

Today is March 14th, 2020 and I am making a few more predictions about the future.

1. The worst of the stock market is yet to come.
2. COVID-19 will continue to spread around the world in the fall.
3. Americans and the CDC will change their mind about the effectiveness of masks and everybody will start wearing them.
